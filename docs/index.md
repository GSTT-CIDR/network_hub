# Metagenomics network hub

!!! Note
    **The tools and documentation described here and on the CIDR GitHub are not validated for diagnostic use and are for research and evaluation purposes only.**

**The Network Hub is a resource for users of the CIDR clinical metagenomics workflow. Here, you can find SOPs, technical and FAQ/troubleshooting information regarding the implementation of metagenomics in a clinical evaluation/research setting.**

### Lab protocols
The lab protocol is a same-day DNA/RNA extraction, host-depletion and ONT library preperation workflow for delivery of preliminary sequencing results in < 6 hours.

### Informatics workflow
The workflow covers the end-to-end processing of respiratory samples sequencing data, delivering a metageonomic report describing the microbial communities within them. The workflow leverages ONT Nanopore sequencing at its core to produce real-time sequencing data on the GridION platform. The informatics workflow runs locally alongside the sequencing experiment, producing reports as early as 30 minutes after commencing sequencing. 

### Reporting framework 
This SOP is applied in a service evaluation setting to parse results from the informatics workflow for application in a clinical evaluation setting
