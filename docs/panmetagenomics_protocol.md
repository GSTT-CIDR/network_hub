    **Risk assessment for handling respiratory samples needs to be performed by each laboratory.**
    <br><br>
    **The tools and documentation described here and on the CIDR GitHub are not validated for diagnostic use and are for research and evaluation purposes only.**

## Preparation of quality controls:

- **Positive control: NATtrol™ Respiratory Panel 2.1 (RP2.1) Controls
  (Zeptometrix):**

1.  Mix 300ul of control 1 and 300ul of control 2 in an Eppendorf. Label
    with date and lot number.

2.  Vortex for 1 minute Centrifuge at 1,200g for 5min immediately prior
    to each use.

3.  Aliquot the volume specified by the manual or automated extraction
    method and process in parallel with equivalent clinical sample
    volumes.

4.  Store the mixed positive controls at 4<supo</supC, it can be used
    for two extractions.

5.  Run a target PCR (Viasure respiratory panel III) anytime a new box
    is opened and recorded it on the trend analysis spreadsheet.

- **Negative control: Respiratory Swab Matrix Negative Control
  (Vircell):**

Add 500ul of Microbial DNA-Free Water to a vial and mix until completely
reconstituted as per manufacturer’s instructions. Vortex for 30 sec to
dissolve and homogenise completely. Spike with 1ul of TMV.

**NOTE:** run the PC and NC using the same barcodes. We use barcode 11
for the PC and 12 for the NC.

- **Internal control (IC): Tobacco Mosaic Virus (TMV) PC-0107 (DSMZ):**

 1\. Reconstitute a new vial of TMV every Monday with 3mL of Microbial
 DNA-Free Water (Qiagen).

 2\. Vortex for 1 minute.

 3\. Aliquot 500ul of IC into 6 Eppendorf tubes, labelling each tube
 with the preparation date and lot number. Store at 4<supo</supC.

 4\. Use one aliquot per day to spike your samples and negative
 control, vortex for one minute before spiking

 5\. Do a target PCR on the aliquot used each time a new vial is
 reconstituted and record the Ct value on the trend analysis
 spreadsheet (see appendix 1). In our hands this is between 0.5ul and
 5ul of TMV to give a final Ct value in the sample of between 5 and 6.

 6\. Discard any remaining volume from used aliquot each day and any
 remaining aliquots by Friday.

 See Appendix 1 for the TMV targeted PCR.

- **Spiking samples with the internal control (IC):**

<!-- --

- Spiked the sample with <u1ul of TMV</u is the following samples:

 -Broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL),

 -Non-directed broncho-alveolar lavage (NBL)

-Endotracheal tube (ETT) aspirates

-Sputum.

- Spike with <u0.5ul of TMV</u the following samples:

 -Pleural fluids

 -Nasal throat swabs

**<uSample preparation:</u**

-Respiratory samples validated for this protocol are: BAL, NBL, ETT,
NTS, sputum and pleural fluids.

-Samples processed should be fresh up to four days old storage in the
fridge, older than that it could not be guarantee the RNA virus
detection.

\- Samples are processed in a different way depending on the sample
type.

**1. Sputum and ETT:**

Mucoid samples such as sputum or ETT should be mucolysed before starting
the Human DNA depletion process as follows:

Add approximately 2 mL sputum into a numbered, sterile, plastic
universal container or if 2 mL already in original container then use
this:

1.  Add equal volume (2mL) of mucolytic agent Mucolyse to the sample
    container.

2.  Vortex in the safety cabinet for 30 seconds.

3.  Leave until liquefication at RT.

4.  Gently agitate for a further 15 seconds before to proceed to the
    human DNA depletion

If after mucolysing the sample, this is still mucoid, pipette 500ul of
the sample and mix with 500ul of PBS, vortex well and proceed with the
human DNA depletion.

**<uHuman DNA depletion:</u**

The human DNA depletion is three steps: centrifugation, bead-beating and
endonuclease treatment. However, BAL, NBL and ETT aspirates are
processed in a different way depending on the appearance of the sample.
This is due to the different composition of the sample.

1.  <uFor turbid and mucoid samples</u: the human DNA depletion is
    performed as usual, centrifugation followed by bead-beating and
    endonuclease treatment.

2.  <uTransparent samples with some mucoid debris:</u the
    centrifugation should be spiked and the only bead-beating and
    endonuclease treatment should be performed.

3.  <uFor clear samples with watery appearance:</u the human DNA
    depletion should be avoided and the sample should just be extracted.

<!-- --

1)  **<uCentrifugation:</u**

☐ Vortex the sample

☐Centrifuge 1,200g for 10 min

☐Aliquot 500ul of the supernatant into an Eppendorf tube

 ☐Vortex the TMV aliquot

 ☐Spike 1ul of TMV to the sample and 0.5ul if processing a pleural
 fluid.

 ☐Vortex the sample with the TMV

☐ Procced with bead beating host-depletion step (2.)

2)  **<uBead beating and microbial extraction</u**:

 ☐Add 500ul of the supernatant post centrifugation or 500ul of whole
 sample to the Matrix Lysing D tube (MP biomedicals<supTM</sup) after
 vortexing for 1 minute.

 ☐ Place the matrix tube into the TissueLyser LT (Qiagen). Bead-beat at
 50 osc for 3min. Note: sometimes the sample will become foamy after
 bead-beating, this is ok.

 ☐Transfer 200ul of the bead-beaten sample to a new Eppendorf tube,
 placing the tip at the bottom of the tube to take-up the liquid
 instead of the foam.

 ☐Add 10ul of HL-SAN enzyme (ArticZymes Technology).

 ☐Mix for 10’ at 37⁰C at 1000rpm in the Eppendorf ThermoMixer
 (Eppendorf<supTM</sup).

 **<uNOTE:</u** The HL-SAN is stopped by the Magnapure extraction
 when the instrument adds proteinase k. However, not all the extraction
 instruments/kits add proteinase k. If the extraction instrument/kit
 does not have this step, add the proteinase K manually as followed:

 -Add 10ul of proteinase K to 200ul of the samples previously treated
 with HL-SAN.

 -Vortex for 10 seconds.

 -Incubate at 56⁰C for 10 min at 1000rpm.

 ☐Transfer 200ul to Magnapure 24 (Roche<supTM</sup) for extraction or
 proceed using alternative extraction methods validated in your own
 laboratory.

 ☐ Use total nucleic acid extraction kit 1.1 with pre-set BAL sample
 parameters and 50ul elution volume. Fast pathogen 200 1.1 is used for
 processing \<8 samples and Pathogen 200 3.2 for \=8 samples. Settings
 for other extraction robots will need to be established in user
 laboratories.
