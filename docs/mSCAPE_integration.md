# mSCAPE upload tool

## Introduction

Following on-boarding to the mSCAPE programme, users can elect to upload samples to mSCAPE using the mSCAPE Launcher. This tool incorporates sample metadata from the Metagenomics Launcher with some additional user inputs, packages human-scrubbed FASTQ data, producing outputs in the required format for an mSCAPE submission.

## Installation

The mSCAPE on-boarding team will provide all of the credentials required to make a test submission. These credentials should be stored in ```metagenomics/configs/mscape_config.yaml```.
